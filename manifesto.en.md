# Remote Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of working remotely by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

* Communication and collaboration over silosing and specialization
* Asynchronicity and just-in-time interaction over instantaneous communication
* Timezones over countries
* Trust over micromanagement

Note to contributors, please add points in the same "xxx over yyy" format only.
