# Principles of Remote Working

1. Overcommunication

Communication in the office also takes place at the coffee machine or in the hallways. Remotely this isn't possible and must be offset with a commitment to overcommunicate in chat, also by explaining what you do in real-time (e.g. " I'm gonna have a coffee!")

Note to contributors, please stick to the "numbered title plus two lines explanation" format. The purpose of the princples is to explain the main manifesto points, not by repeating them, but by showing how to take them and apply them to everyday work.

We are in "brainstorm" mode now: feel free to add what comes to your mind, don't delete or change others' work (except grammar).
